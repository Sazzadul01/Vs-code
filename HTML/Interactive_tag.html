        <summary> Diabetic prediction</summary>
        <p>The paper discusses early prediction of diabetes is crucial for effective disease management and reduction of associated
             health complications. This study used a publicly available diabetes dataset to build predictive models to identify 
             individuals at risk of developing diabetes. The dataset includes key demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors that
              influence the onset of diabetes. An extensive data preprocessing pipeline was applied, including handling missing values,
               feature scaling, and outlier detection. Several machine learning algorithms, such as random forest and decision tree, 
               were evaluated to determine the best model. Performance confusion  metrics, including precision, accuracy, recall, and 
               F1-score, were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Our findings show that random forest achieved the highest
                prediction accuracy of 0.9683%, highlighting the potential for reliable diabetes prediction.  This research underscores
                 the utility of machine learning in healthcare and provides a foundation for developing decision-support systems to aid
                  in early diagnosis and intervention in diabetes.</p>
